# CCHS_DataChallenge

The Robert H Smith School of Business - Healthcare Analytics Data Challenge

The participants were given data from Canadian Community Health Survey and the crux of the study was to find if among Canadian adults (20-64 years of age), is having osteoarthritis associated with developing heart disease. My team aggregated data from three cycles of the CCHS survey (1.1, 2.1, 3.1) - 2966 variables with 402778 rows. After extensive data wrangling, cleaning and feature selection we profiled the data based on factors that are usually categorized  as high risk for the mentions health disorders. The key findings are as follows - 
- The odds of developing CVD is 14% higher among women with OA than men with OA
- The odds of developing CVD is 20% higher among people with OA in Northern Canada than people with OA in Southern Canada.
- The odds of developing CVD is 61.61% higher among people with OA who are single or single and never married than all others.
- The odds of developing CVD is 61.61% higher among people with OA who are single or single and never married than all others.
Further supplemented the findings by drafting a social campaign to raise awareness around prevention/care measures.
